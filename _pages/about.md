I'm a writer and academic. I was formerly an assistant professor of English at Miami University of Ohio before recently relocating to South Orange, NJ with my family. I recently published [Enlightenment Links: Theories of Mind and Media in Eighteenth-Century Britain](https://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=34939) in Stanford University Press' _Text Technologies_ series. I am currently developing freelance writing and coding projects while starting to plan my next book.
