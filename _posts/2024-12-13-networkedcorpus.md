My [Networked Corpus](https://www.networkedcorpus.site/) website, built with Jeffrey Binder, is back up. This was one of my first digital projects, and it was also an early approach to analyzing how computational methods works by reading their results against older models of organizing text. In this case, we read a topic model of Adam Smith's _Wealth of Nations_ against the comprehensive subject index of the work. We wanted to see how a statistical model of what a text is 'about' compares with an older, rhetorical theory of meaning.
